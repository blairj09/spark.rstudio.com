## Overview

Qubole users can request [beta access to RStudio Server
pro](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/engines/spark/rstudio_spark.html).
This allows users to use [`sparklyr`](https://spark.rstudio.com/) to interact
directly with Spark from within the Qubole cluster.

## Advantages and limitations

Advantages:

- Ability for users to connect `sparklyr` directly to Spark within Qubole
- Provides a high-bandwidth connection between R and the Spark JVM processes
  because they are running on the same machine
- Can load data from the cluster directly into an R session since RStudio Server
  Pro is installed within the Qubole cluster
- A unique home directory for each user

Limitations:

- Persistent packages must be managed from the Environments page, not directly
  from within RStudio
- If users do not persist their code through version control or the Databricks
  File System, then you risk losing user's work if the cluster is restarted or
  terminated
- RStudio Server Pro installed within a Qubole
  cluster will be limited to the compute resources and lifecycle of that
  particular Spark cluster
- Non-Spark jobs will use CPU and RAM resources within the Qubole cluster

## Access RStudio Server Pro

Once Beta access has been enabled, RStudio Server Pro can be accessed from the cluster resources menu.

## Use `sparklyr`

Use the following R code to establish a connection from `sparklyr` to the
Qubole cluster:

```
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(method = "qubole")
```

## Additional information
